# Tutorial for nubs

## Installing

### First install python

1. Go to [This website](https://python.org/downloads)
2. Download latest version of python (3.11.3 atm)
3. Install it (dont think you need a tutorial for that)

### Then SussyLauncher

1. Click the green button that says "<> Code"
2. Click download zip
3. Move the zip to your desktop
4. Right click it and click "Extract all"
5. Click Extract
6. A file explorer window should open (if not just open the extracted folder)
7. Shift right click SussyLauncher-main then click "Open PowerShell window here"
8. Type the following command in the powershell window:

    ```batch
    python -m pip install -r dependencies.txt
    ```

9. Wait for it to finish, close powershell and return to file explorer
10. Open the folder
11. Open src
12. Open Installer
13. Run install.pyw
14. Click install
15. Wait for a popup saying its done

Hopefully you should find SussyLauncher at your desktop

Otherwise you can use a portable install and just run src/SussyLauncher V1.7.pyw (create a shortcut to it)
