## Installing fabric

- 2. Enter the minecraft version you want to install.
- 3. Wait untill its done.
- 4. Launch SussyLauncher and run it!

Note: </br>
If the fabric install script crashes, it isint supported on your system. This might be because of your organisations group policy since it needs to install java runtime. You can still copy files over from another computer.
